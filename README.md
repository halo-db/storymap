# Objective of Work

With help of Story Mapping (see below), we aim to work out, how the ideal HALO Database should look like. On that basis, we want to discuss how to proceed with the current HALO database. Is a complete remake desired? Or could a number of changes be implemented to approach the ideal HALO database significantly?

It is unlikely that we obtain an unambiguous picture about the ideal state of the HALO database. Instead, several conflicting priorities might become apparent. A clear phrasing of these conflicting priorities and their implications on other aspects of the HALO database are another important goal of our work. Thus, we can facilitate the decision making process in the HALO scientific steering committee.

# Story mapping 

## Intro

 - First, we create personas (see Issue #1) and define their individual goals.
 - Then we look at how these virtual people would use the system to achieve their goals.
 - This will lead to small or large use cases, which we will collect as Github-issues and chronologically organise in a Github-project.
 
The whole thing is called "story mapping" and provides us with the big picture and at the same time a detailed look at what exactly is required of the system.

## Persona

In issue https://github.com/halo-db/storymap/issues/1 we collect our persona. We should have a few to think about the different user groups. We might also notice that a certain persona we have invented is not part of the target group of the HALO-DB, which would also be ok. 

## Story board

Our story board is here:
https://github.com/halo-db/storymap/projects/1

We imagine that we go through the system from left to right together with one of our personas: "First log in, then ...". As we do this, a number of "use cases" naturally come to mind, which we can create as Github-issues and then move to the appropriate column in the "board". If we notice that we are missing a column, we simply add it. 

## Use cases

We follow the following scheme for our use cases:

As **USER ROLE** I want **ACTION** to **USE**.

e.g.:
*As a scientific user, I would like to upload data to share this data with colleagues.
